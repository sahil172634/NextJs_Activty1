We feel incredibly lucky that we had her to explain the different parts of the process and answer the many questions we had. We said to one another multiple times 'Thank god for Carley, she's incredible.' It meant a lot that she was so forward with getting details, and advocating for us with the sellers and always keeping us up to date with what was happening. We can't thank her enough for everything she did for us.`,

    description: `We are first time property buyers and were buying a block of land - Carley from Settle Easy was absolutely amazing from start to finish. She went above and beyond at every single stage of the process, keeping us in the loop the entire time, explaining what she was doing and why, making sure we understood what was happening. Buying a property is stressful enough, you don't need the extra worry of a Conveyancer that needs constant chasing. Incredible service!`,
